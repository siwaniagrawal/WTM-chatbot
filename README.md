# WTM-chatbot
<h2>Project Description</h2>
Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people through the use of artificial intelligence. 
In a nutshell, when someone types in a message, the bot responds with the right reply. 
I'll be building a messenger bot for a Facebook page which responds on my behalf. 
I’ll try to include a tinge of NLP processing using Google’s DialogFlow platform.

<h3>Outcomes:</h3> Develop a messenger chatbot powered by DialogFlow for NLP. A basic understanding of bot frameworks which’ll help build bots on any platform (eg. telegram) in future.
<h3>Installations</h3>
Prerequisites: Node.js

<h3>Technology stack</h3>
Languages and frameworks: Node.js, Express

<h3>A rough outline:-</h3>
<li>Install and setup Node.js and NPM on the local machine</li>
<li>Create a basic request-response server using Node.js </li>
<li>Writing the first two most important endpoints - 1.Facebook initial token verification 2.Other messages from Facebook Messenger</li>
<li>Setting up local proxy server using ngrok.</li>
<li>After having the facebook page and application ready along with  basic web server,  to handle the to-be incoming free texts from the facebook page. I’ll use DialogFlow for this.</li>
<li>Time to write code to process the incoming messages</li>
<li>After choosing a use-case, which could be a Hotel Reservation bot, a Travel bot, a Restaurant Menu bot or anything. I'll be creating intents on DialogFlow accordingly</li>.
<li>Finally depolying the  node server on heroku.</li>
